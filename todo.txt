1/ previous changes to svg processing were moved to CNC.py as they are
general for any type of set of paths to be drawn as curves, not just
svg.

2/ Try using a plugin to set svg values - at present the
default feed, up and down positions
and curve dissection number and scaling factor and DPI are hard coded

Maybe find the DPI in the comments field of the svg rather than using
96 - 

3/ Put some debugging functions under a control parameter uch as
debug_level,
and move others to a stash or a fork for merging in when needed
